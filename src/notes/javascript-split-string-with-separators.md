Use the Javascript split() function with a `Positive Lookbehind Regular Expression` to split a string while preserving the separators in the sub-strings:

```javascript
split(/(?<=[<separator characters go here>])/)
```

## What is Lookbehind?
Lookbehind in regular-expression allows to match a pattern only when it follows the given lookbehind pattern (without actually matching it).

### Syntax
* Positive lookbehind: `(?<=Y)X` matches X if there is Y before it.
* Negative lookbehind: `(?<!Y)X` matches X if there is no Y before it.

***One limitation*** is that Javascript only supports fixed length lookbehind patterns. So, you cannot use it to split by a separator pattern with variable length.
