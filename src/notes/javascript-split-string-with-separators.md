Use the Javascript split() function with a `Positive Look-behind Regular Expression` to split a string while preserving the separators in the sub-strings:

```javascript
split(/(?<=[<separator characters go here>])/)
```

> Look-behind in regular-expression allows to match a pattern only when it follows the given look-behind pattern (without actually matching it).

***One limitation*** is that Javascript only supports fix length look-behind regular expression patterns. So, you cannot split by a separator pattern wit variable length.
